                Final Design
            </h3>
            <p>
                The length of the wallete represents the depth and layers of the ground where the gnomes live and when you put coins in this wallet it becomes the treasure that the gnomes protect underneath. I added a zipper to make the coins at the bottom more accessible. I also added card slots and an ID holder for different wallet items. I folded it in half where it can be used horizontally with the zipper or as originally designed. This also alludes to the gnomes small size.

            <p>
                his project has taught me a lot about the design process and made me realize how much thought goes into a single product. One thing I struggled with was creating 50 iterations because I ran out of ideas of ways to stretch a wallet as a gnome. However, I have enjoyed getting to use my creativity and pushing my thinking to build my gnome-wallet!
