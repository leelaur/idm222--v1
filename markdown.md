# My Work

## **Collider Redesign**
tag: UI, Redesign
(see [wordpress](https://laurnl33.wordpress.com/collider-redesign/)) <br />
**Goal:** Create a responsive interface that reflects the content of the website.
### What is Collider News?
Collider is a news site that updates on the latest news and upcoming projects in entertainment. 
### New Colors
The colors were chosen from Collider's current logo along with other colors inspired by the "no signal" color blocks from a broken TV. This allusion relates to the entertainment/ TV news Collider reports. 
### Wireframe Sketches
Wireframes were drawn on paper for each device size (mobile, tablet, computer) one for the home page and another for the article page.
### Final Sketch
In combination with the three sketcheds, the final sketch was created. 

### Final Thoughts
Through this project, I have learned how to create responsive web designs and understand the importance of considering perspectives to accommodate different users.

## **Mythical Creature Wallet**
tag: product design, research
(see [wordpress](https://laurnl33.wordpress.com/mythical-creature-wallet/)) <br />
**Goal:** Design a wallet that associates with the mythical creature, the gnome.
### Research
What is a wallet?
- The first wallet was used to carry coins but evolved to carry paper currency in 1980, and evolved again to carry cards in the 20th century
- Most wallets were designed to fit in your pocket

What is a Gnome?
- Gnomes protect treasure hidden underground where they live 
- Gnomes are known to be guardians of the earth <br />

### Observations <br />

How do people use there wallets? What kind of wallets do people use?
- People take swift motions to get out money and return to pocket
- Most people used bi-fold wallets
- Most people would just shove change into pocket

### Storyboard
insert storyboard image. 


What does the user need?
- An easy way to fit in pocket
- A quick way to take out and put in money

### Ideation and Iteration 
insert image.

### Final Design 
The length of the wallete represents the depth and layers of the ground where the gnomes live and when you put coins in this wallet it becomes the treasure that the gnomes protect underneath. I added a zipper to make the coins at the bottom more accessible. I also added card slots and an ID holder for different wallet items. I folded it in half where it can be used horizontally with the zipper or as originally designed. This also alludes to the gnomes small size. <br />

### Final Thoughts
This project has taught me a lot about the design process and made me realize how much thought goes into a single product. One thing I struggled with was creating 50 iterations because I ran out of ideas of ways to stretch a wallet as a gnome. However, I have enjoyed getting to use my creativity and pushing my thinking to build my gnome-wallet!
